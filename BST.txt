BST Notes
Tree is undirected graph in which any two vetices are connected by exactly one path 
meaning acayclic undirected graph.
every node in the bst can have most two children: left children is smaller than parent node while right children are higher than parent.
Height of a bst tree is O(logn) layer 1 has 2^0 nodes, layer 2 has 2^1 nodes, layer 3 has 2^2...etc
Balance tree : running time is O(logn)
Imbalanced tree : running time is O(n)
