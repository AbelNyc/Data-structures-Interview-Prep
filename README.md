## **Questions Solved**

### Easy Questions
1. **Climbing Stairs**
   - Approach: Solved using memoization.
   - Reflection: Straightforward Fibonacci-like recurrence.

2. **Min Cost Climbing Stairs**
   - Approach: Solved using memoization.
   - Reflection: Built confidence with simple state definition and recurrence.

3. **Unique Paths**
   - Approach: Used recursion and memoization.
   - Reflection: Not hard; straightforward recurrence with grid bounds.

4. **Unique Paths II**
   - Approach: Solved using memoization, handled blockers with `grid[row][col] == 1`.
   - Reflection: Straightforward adaptation of Unique Paths I.

### Medium Questions
1. **House Robber**
   - Approach: Solved using top-down DP with memoization.
   - Reflection: Learned how to make decisions to maximize outcomes.

2. **House Robber II**
   - Approach: Handled circular constraints with two separate cases.
   - Reflection: Strengthened decision-making pattern understanding.

### Hard Questions
1. **Unique Paths III**
   - Approach: Deferred solving for later; recognized the need to improve handling complex constraints and backtracking.
   - Reflection: Feels hard but manageable with further practice.

## **Reflections**

### Strengths
1. **Breaking Problems into Subproblems**:
   - Learned to define state and recurrence (e.g., House Robber, Climbing Stairs).
2. **Memoization Proficiency**:
   - Feels natural and efficient for avoiding redundant calculations.
3. **Quick Recognition of Problem Simplicity**:
   - Identified straightforward problems (e.g., Unique Paths I & II).

### Struggles
1. **Tabulation Understanding**:
   - Need to develop intuition for bottom-up DP.
2. **Complex Constraints**:
   - Struggle with problems requiring advanced constraints (e.g., Unique Paths III).

### Improvements
- Confidence in memoization and simpler problems.
- Building a foundation for harder problems by solving more patterns.

## **Roadmap**

### Goals
1. **Master Fundamental DP Patterns**:
   - Fibonacci/Linear Recurrence
   - Maximize/Minimize Decisions
   - Subset Sum/Knapsack
   - Grid Pathfinding
   - String Transformations

2. **Expand to Tabulation**:
   - Learn bottom-up DP for efficiency.
   - Practice translating recursive solutions to iterative ones.

3. **Simulate Real Interviews**:
   - Solve problems under time pressure.
   - Practice explaining solutions interactively.

---

### Practice Plan
- Solve 2-3 problems for each pattern.
- Alternate between easy and medium questions.
- Revisit hard questions like Unique Paths III after mastering patterns.
- Track progress weekly and reflect on struggles and improvements.

## **Feedback**
1. **What I’m Proud Of**:
   - Gaining confidence with memoization and solving simpler problems quickly.
2. **What I’m Improving**:
   - Tackling harder constraints and practicing tabulation.
3. **Next Steps**:
   - Solve 3 medium DP problems this week and review Unique Paths III later.
